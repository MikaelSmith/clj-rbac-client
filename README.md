# rbac-client

A Clojure library designed to hold lightweight api clients for pe services.

## Usage

The clients are mean to provide alternate versions of the tk services. You should be able to merely include them in the bootstrap.

###Configuration

The clients use ssl authorization vs the global.certs keys.

- `global.certs.ssl-key`: the key for this clients identity.
- `global.certs.ssl-cert`: the cert for this clients identity.
- `global.certs.ssl-ca-cert`: the ca-cert for this clients cert and the upstream service.

The location of the rbac and activity services are configured with the
`rbac-consumer.api-url` and `activity-consumer.api.url` settings respectivetly

###Activity

The activity service protocol should be considered temporary and unstable. It's
unclear to me how well this matches the activityreporting service or how stable
that protocol is.
